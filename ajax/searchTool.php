There is\r\nalso a deep appreciation of the \u201cfeeling\u201d of the\r\nmaterial and there are pieces of jade designed\r\nand kept entirely to be handled and felt. The\r\nsurface is said to glow with the inner life and\r\nimpart the symbolic qualities of the jade to\r\nthe handler. The polish representing purity,\r\nits smoothness, benevolence; its compactness,\r\nstrength and sureness of the intellect; angular,\r\nbut not sharp, it is justice; hanging in beads,\r\nit is humility; its flaws, which are not concealed,\r\nbut do not mar its beauty, are loyalty;\r\nits transparency is sincerity; it is mysterious\r\nand iridescent as the heavens and is formed of\r\nthe mountains and the waters of the earth; the\r\nvalue of all men set upon it represents truth.\r\nSculpture seems to have played a comparatively\r\ninsignificant part in China, with\r\nthe exception of the vast figures used in the\r\nimperial tombs and the T\u2019ang stelae, until the\r\nadvent of Buddhism.\r\nIn architecture, the forms of buildings,\r\nwhether pagodas, palaces, or private houses,\r\nwere designed either to merge into the landscape,\r\nor to pick up and accentuate some\r\noutstanding beauty of scene and setting. The\r\nposition of monasteries was chosen for natural\r\nbeauty and the solitude of contemplation,\r\nbut all buildings, as with all other branches of\r\nChinese art, carried no weight of permanence\r\nor sense of solidarity, so that the transitory is\r\nsuggested and all is an embodiment of the\r\nphilosophy of the rhythm of the universe and\r\nits constant interactions. Metaphysics inspires\r\nart and art gives rise to metaphysics.","COUNTRY_ID":"14","REGION_ID":"3","CITY_ID":"3368","PIC_ID":"36","ALBUM_ID":"1","RANK":"2","TOKEN":"0"},{"ID_USER":"6","NAME":"prueba1","LASTNAME":"prueba1","NICKNAME":"p1","EMAIL":"prueba@1.com","PASSWORD":"7110eda4d09e062aa5e4a390b0a572ac0d2c0220","ABOUT":null,"COUNTRY_ID":null,"REGION_ID":null,"CITY_ID":null,"PIC_ID":null,"ALBUM_ID":null,"RANK":"0","TOKEN":"343f0ca6b0182229b8ea83ed31e094671e4082af"},{"ID_USER":"7","NAME":"prueba2","LASTNAME":"prueba2","NICKNAME":"p2","EMAIL":"prueba@2.com","PASSWORD":"7110eda4d09e062aa5e4a390b0a572ac0d2c0220","ABOUT":null,"COUNTRY_ID":null,"REGION_ID":null,"CITY_ID":null,"PIC_ID":null,"ALBUM_ID":null,"RANK":"0","TOKEN":"d91fd6bee46671f93e3bdd3f285749c7dd7f9428"},{"ID_USER":"8","NAME":"pedro","LASTNAME":"picapiedra","NICKNAME":"peter","EMAIL":"pedro@picapiedra.com","PASSWORD":"7110eda4d09e062aa5e4a390b0a572ac0d2c0220","ABOUT":null,"COUNTRY_ID":"10","REGION_ID":"1055","CITY_ID":"14678","PIC_ID":null,"ALBUM_ID":"2","RANK":"0","TOKEN":"89b807e30c0c9dbab1ed360a6e4a3d0b5a3870fa"},{"ID_USER":"9","NAME":"we","LASTNAME":"we","NICKNAME":"we","EMAIL":"we@we.com","PASSWORD":"676e6f35cfc173f73fea9fe27699cf8185397f0c","ABOUT":null,"COUNTRY_ID":null,"REGION_ID":null,"CITY_ID":null,"PIC_ID":null,"ALBUM_ID":null,"RANK":"0","TOKEN":"0"},{"ID_USER":"10","NAME":"qwe","LASTNAME":"qwe","NICKNAME":"qwe","EMAIL":"qwe@qwe.com","PASSWORD":"056eafe7cf52220de2df36845b8ed170c67e23e3","ABOUT":null,"COUNTRY_ID":null,"REGION_ID":null,"CITY_ID":null,"PIC_ID":null,"ALBUM_ID":null,"RANK":"0","TOKEN":"0"},{"ID_USER":"11","NAME":"Test","LASTNAME":"Test","NICKNAME":"testnick","EMAIL":"test@test.com","PASSWORD":"7110eda4d09e062aa5e4a390b0a572ac0d2c0220","ABOUT":null,"COUNTRY_ID":null,"REGION_ID":null,"CITY_ID":null,"PIC_ID":null,"ALBUM_ID":null,"RANK":"0","TOKEN":"0"},{"ID_USER":"12","NAME":"asdfasdd","LASTNAME":"Sdfasdf","NICKNAME":"asdfasd","EMAIL":"dsfadf@asdfads.com","PASSWORD":"a056c8d05ae9ac6ca180bc991b93b7ffe37563e0","ABOUT":null,"COUNTRY_ID":"3","REGION_ID":"540","CITY_ID":null,"PIC_ID":null,"ALBUM_ID":null,"RANK":"0","TOKEN":"0"},{"ID_USER":"13","NAME":"aaaaaaaaaaaaa","LASTNAME":"aaaaaaaaaaaaa","NICKNAME":"aaaaaaaaaaaaaa","EMAIL":"aaaaaaaaa@aaaaaaaaaa.com","PASSWORD":"7e240de74fb1ed08fa08d38063f6a6a91462a815","ABOUT":null,"COUNTRY_ID":"1","REGION_ID":"823","CITY_ID":null,"PIC_ID":null,"ALBUM_ID":null,"RANK":"0","TOKEN":"0"},{"ID_USER":"14","NAME":"bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb","LASTNAME":"bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb","NICKNAME":"bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb","EMAIL":"bbbbbbbbbbbb@bbbbbb.com","PASSWORD":"5cb138284d431abd6a053a56625ec088bfb88912","ABOUT":null,"COUNTRY_ID":"18","REGION_ID":"555","CITY_ID":null,"PIC_ID":null,"ALBUM_ID":null,"RANK":"0","TOKEN":"0"},{"ID_USER":"15","NAME":"vvvv","LASTNAME":"vvv","NICKNAME":"vvvv","EMAIL":"vvvv@vvv.com","PASSWORD":"dbe6cae2f52b55095b513c15321b934146828d76","ABOUT":null,"COUNTRY_ID":"4","REGION_ID":null,"CITY_ID":null,"PIC_ID":null,"ALBUM_ID":null,"RANK":"0","TOKEN":"0"},{"ID_USER":"16","NAME":"julian","LASTNAME":"julian","NICKNAME":"julian","EMAIL":"saudadeh@gmail.com","PASSWORD":"7110eda4d09e062aa5e4a390b0a572ac0d2c0220","ABOUT":null,"COUNTRY_ID":"1","REGION_ID":"823","CITY_ID":null,"PIC_ID":null,"ALBUM_ID":null,"RANK":"0","TOKEN":"f60263256f09f65d2352846f6af515a6120ae10d"}]
